Getting started
========

In this assignment, you will create a GitHub repository for the course.  A link will be posted in Slack with detailed instructions.

Once your repository is created, you will submit a practice deliverable via GitHub.  Like all the deliverables, this one will be a blog post. 

-   The audience of your blog post is the Vanderbilt Data Science community.

-   Your post will be a brief profile about a fellow student (assigned randomly to you in class).

-   The profile can include professional details (What was her/his journey to data science?), and it can also include informal details such as hobbies, hometown, favorite books/movies/artists, etc. 

### Submission instructions

1.  Within your course repo, create a folder called `00-student-profile`
1.  Within the folder, create an .html file with the name
    `writeup`
1.  Be prepared to share your blog post with the class when the
    deliverable is due
1.  The deliverable should be your own work.  You may **discuss**
    concepts with classmates, and you may **share** code or text.
